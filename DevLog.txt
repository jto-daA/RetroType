[ 9/16/06 ]  
Starting project over from scratch... After a CPU melt ( which can't presently be replaced ), 
a move halfway across the country, and a completely different dev box ( albeit temporarily ),
it's time to start this over from ground-zero. Also, I have scratched writing all the engine 
code over again, and instead, opted to use a Win32 implementation of Allegro. I am looking forward
to coding outside of the ungainly restrictions of message handling an all that other Win32 API bollocks.
On with the coding.

[ 9/18/06 ]
Working on logic. Hoping to have a working version up by the end of the week ( at the very latest ). 

[ 9/20/06 ]
Researching/writing timing routines.

[ 9/24/06 ]
After just one week, I am already farther along, that with the previous iteration. Graphics ( placeholder )
are up and running. 95% of hard-coded stuff has been revised. Now, on with the logic coding. 

[ 9/26/06 ]
Coding is coming along very nicely. Today, will start determing how and what 'links' to incorporate. 

[ 10/01/06 ]
Working version with scoring up and running. System for dual view operational, but not the focus of 
development at this point. Next week ( if possible ) aim will be on finalizing the easy mode logic, and 
spending the rest of the week on everything *but* content. 

[ 10/02/06 ] 
Researching pixel art resources. Unfortunately, game dev will very likely come to a halt this week... Relocating 
*again* to DC...

[ 10/06/06 ] 
Made an animation for the intro screen. Logic is nearing completion. Need to work out some final bugs, but will 
start focusing on front-end code/resources.

[ 10/12/06 ]
Working on game content. So far, have made alpha-version : intro_screens (2) , cube sprites, and am now working on
font set. Will work more on coding this weekend.

[ 10/14/06 ]
Game running with sprites. Next phase of development is developing the code and content for the game stages. At this point, 2
stages are planned. This is the last major phase, after which comes menus, file specs, tweaking/debugging and whatever else.

[ 10/19/06 ]
Coding some cool boids/water routines. 

[ 10/22/06 ]
Starting writing GUI routines. Code has reached approx 4,100 LOC.

[ 10/27/06 ] Time to start another weekend of coding :) It is very possible, that at the end of these next 2 days, I will have a very
functional beta running ( barring unforseen bugs to resolve ). At this point, there are several things that,while working, need 
much fine tuning. My misison for this break, is to implement the level progression,and fine tune/fix logic so that the game may be played
in a natural manner...
